**Our Mission**

3TZ Tech corp is introducing the cooking app, “Chef It Up”, that will help and motivate people to start cooking and make cooking fun and rewarding. The app will feature hundreds of cooking recipes that 
people can make and all the step by step instructions on how to do them. It will motivate and reward users for completing recipes with an in-app character/account that level ups. On top of this, we have 
partnered with our local grocery store and we have implemented a reward system for users to purchase ingredients from the recipes they are completing and to get coupons after a certain amount of purchases.
